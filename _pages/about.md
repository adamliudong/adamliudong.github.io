<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received the BEng (Hons) in electronic engineering with first class from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2014, BEng in microelectronics from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2014, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2019. I was a postdoc with the Institute of Textile and Clothing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and is now a postdoc with the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. I am currently the full member  of  the  IEEE  Power  and  Energy  Circuits  and  Systems Technical Committee, and member of IEEE Power and Energy Society. My research interests include cascading faliure modeling and analysis, cyber-physical systems, and machine learning for robustness assessment in smart grids.
